We received approval from the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA and commercialized our first\nproduct in 2006 and are currently commercializing our fifth generation CGM system. Unless the context requires otherwise, the terms \"we,\" \"us,\" \"our,\" the\n\"company,\" or \"DexCom\" refer to DexCom, Inc. and its subsidiaries.\nProducts\nDexCom G5 ® Mobile\nIn August 2015, we received approval from the FDA for the DexCom G5 ® Mobile Continuous Glucose Monitoring System, also referred to as the G5\nMobile. The G5 Mobile is designed to allow our transmitter to run the Software 505 algorithm that historically had operated on the receiver, and to communicate\ndirectly to a patient's mobile device, including iPhone ® , iPod touch ® , iPad ® , or certain Android mobile digital devices. The G5 Mobile transmitter has a labeled\nuseful life of three months. Data from the G5 Mobile can be integrated with DexCom CLARITY TM , our next generation cloud-based reporting software, for\npersonalized, easy-to-understand analysis of trends that may improve diabetes management. We previously received CE Mark approval for, and in September 2015\nwe launched, the G5 Mobile in certain countries in Europe.\nThe sensor is inserted by the user and is intended to be used continuously for up to seven days, after which it may be replaced with a new disposable sensor.\nOur transmitter is reusable until it reaches the end of its battery life. Our receiver is reusable. As we establish an installed base of customers using our products, we\nexpect to generate an increasing portion of our revenues through recurring sales of our disposable sensors. In December 2016, the FDA approved the G5 Mobile as\nthe first CGM system in the United States to have a non-adjunctive indication. The non-adjunctive indication expands the lawfully permitted use of the G5 Mobile\nas a replacement to finger stick glucose testing for diabetes treatment decisions. With the new label indication, the G5 Mobile only requires two finger pricks per\nday for calibration. In the countries and regions outside of the United States that recognize the CE Mark, as well as the United States and Canada, the G5 Mobile\nalso does not require confirmatory finger sticks when making treatment decisions, although a minimum of two finger sticks a day remain necessary for calibration.\nApproval of the non-adjunctive indication also was an important and necessary step in enabling people with Medicare to access CGM.\nExcept with respect to the foregoing, the G5 Mobile is equivalent to the G4 ® PLATINUM System in its technical capabilities and its regulatory requirements\nand indications.\nDexCom G4 ® PLATINUM\nThe DexCom G4 PLATINUM continuous glucose monitoring system replaced our legacy DexCom SEVEN PLUS system beginning in 2012, when it was\napproved for up to seven days of continuous use by adults with diabetes. Since 2012, we have marketed the DexCom G4 PLATINUM under a Conformité\nEuropéenne Marking, or CE Mark, in the European Union, Australia, New Zealand and the countries in Asia and Latin America that recognize the CE Mark, and in\nthe United States with approval from the FDA. We received approvals for a pediatric indication under the CE Mark in February 2013 and from the FDA in\nFebruary 2014, enabling us to market and sell this system to persons two years old and older who have diabetes (hereinafter referred to as the \"Pediatric\nIndication\"). In June 2014, we received approval from the FDA for an expanded indication for the DexCom G4 PLATINUM for professional use, which allows\nhealthcare professionals to purchase the DexCom G4 PLATINUM system for use with multiple patients. Healthcare professionals can use the insights gained from\na DexCom G4 PLATINUM professional session to adjust therapy and to educate and motivate patients to modify their behavior after viewing the effects that\nspecific foods, exercise, stress and medications have on their glucose levels. In October 2014, we launched our Software 505 for the DexCom G4 PLATINUM, an\nalgorithm which enabled our systems to achieve a single digit MARD - a measure of the accuracy of continuous glucose monitoring. We believe our CGM systems\nare currently the most consistently accurate available for continuous glucose monitoring.\nDexCom Share ®\nIn 2015, we received approval from the FDA for the DexCom G4 PLATINUM with Share and began commercializing this product in the United States in\nthe first quarter of 2015 using a secure wireless connection between a patient’s G4 PLATINUM receiver and an app. We now offer this feature directly from the\ntransmitter through the G5 Mobile app. The\n4",{"entities":[[111,140,"MEDICAL DEVICE TECHNOLOGY"],[145,156,"MEDICAL DEVICE TECHNOLOGY"],[180,188,"DISEASE"],[248,276,"LAW"],[281,284,"LAW"],[368,396,"MEDICAL DEVICE TECHNOLOGY"],[545,563,"MEDICAL DEVICE TECHNOLOGY"],[610,613,"LAW"],[622,677,"MEDICAL DEVICE TECHNOLOGY"],[703,713,"MEDICAL DEVICE TECHNOLOGY"],[718,727,"MEDICAL DEVICE TECHNOLOGY"],[776,798,"MEDICAL DEVICE TECHNOLOGY"],[997,1018,"MEDICAL DEVICE TECHNOLOGY"],[1076,1085,"MEDICAL DEVICE TECHNOLOGY"],[1109,1126,"MEDICAL DEVICE TECHNOLOGY"],[1254,1262,"DISEASE"],[1298,1305,"LAW"],[1359,1368,"MEDICAL DEVICE TECHNOLOGY"],[1859,1862,"LAW"],[1876,1885,"MEDICAL DEVICE TECHNOLOGY"],[1899,1909,"MEDICAL DEVICE TECHNOLOGY"],[2040,2049,"MEDICAL DEVICE TECHNOLOGY"],[2083,2090,"CHEMICALS"],[2103,2111,"DISEASE"],[2168,2177,"MEDICAL DEVICE TECHNOLOGY"],[2366,2375,"MEDICAL DEVICE TECHNOLOGY"],[2664,2668,"MEDICAL DEVICE TECHNOLOGY"],[2711,2720,"MEDICAL DEVICE TECHNOLOGY"],[2742,2755,"MEDICAL DEVICE TECHNOLOGY"],[2849,2862,"MEDICAL DEVICE TECHNOLOGY"],[2874,2885,"MEDICAL DEVICE TECHNOLOGY"],[2897,2922,"MEDICAL DEVICE TECHNOLOGY"],[2950,2960,"MEDICAL DEVICE TECHNOLOGY"],[3112,3123,"MEDICAL DEVICE TECHNOLOGY"],[3132,3161,"LAW"],[3166,3173,"LAW"],[3284,3291,"LAW"],[3341,3345,"LAW"],[3405,3412,"LAW"],[3443,3446,"LAW"],[3552,3560,"DISEASE"],[3662,3665,"LAW"],[3701,3719,"MEDICAL DEVICE TECHNOLOGY"],[3796,3814,"MEDICAL DEVICE TECHNOLOGY"],[3914,3932,"MEDICAL DEVICE TECHNOLOGY"],[4128,4135,"CHEMICALS"],[4177,4189,"MEDICAL DEVICE TECHNOLOGY"],[4198,4216,"MEDICAL DEVICE TECHNOLOGY"],[4330,4337,"CHEMICALS"],[4365,4376,"MEDICAL DEVICE TECHNOLOGY"],[4447,4454,"CHEMICALS"],[4521,4524,"LAW"],[4533,4551,"MEDICAL DEVICE TECHNOLOGY"],[4707,4718,"MEDICAL DEVICE TECHNOLOGY"],[4808,4822,"MEDICAL DEVICE TECHNOLOGY"]]}],["\fDexCom Share remote monitoring system uses an app on the patient's iPhone, iPod touch, iPad, Apple Watch TM or Android mobile digital device to transmit\nglucose information to apps on the mobile devices of up to five designated recipients, or \"followers\", who can remotely monitor a patient's glucose information and\nreceive alert notifications anywhere they have an Internet or cellular connection.\nData & Insulin Delivery Collaborations\nWe have entered into multiple collaboration agreements that leverage our technology platform to integrate our continuous glucose monitoring products with\ninsulin delivery systems. The general purpose of these development and commercial relationships is to integrate our technology into the insulin pump or pen\nproduct offerings of the respective partner, enabling the partner's insulin delivery device to receive and display glucose readings from our transmitter and, in some\ncases, use the glucose readings for semi-automated insulin delivery. Currently, we have announced insulin delivery partnerships with Beta Bionics, Diabeloop, Eli\nLilly, Insulet, Tandem and TypeZero Technologies. In addition to these major partners, we are working with other companies that are pursuing varying strategies\nsurrounding semi-automated insulin delivery and data analytics to improve outcomes and ease-of-use in diabetes management.\nVerily Collaboration\nIn August 2015, we entered into a Collaboration and License Agreement (“Verily Collaboration Agreement”) with Google Life Sciences LLC, now named\nVerily Life Sciences (“Verily”). Pursuant to the Verily Collaboration Agreement, we and Verily have agreed to jointly develop a series of next-generation\ncontinuous glucose monitoring products. The Verily Collaboration Agreement provides us with an exclusive license to use certain intellectual property of Verily\nrelated to the development, manufacture and commercialization of the products contemplated under the Verily Collaboration Agreement. The Verily Collaboration\nAgreement provides for the establishment of a joint steering committee, joint development committee and joint commercialization committee to oversee and\ncoordinate the parties’ activities under the collaboration. We and Verily have agreed to make committee decisions by consensus. Certain amendments were made\nto this agreement in October 2016.\nFuture Products\nWe plan to develop future generations of technologies focused on improved performance and convenience and that will enable intelligent insulin\nadministration. We also are aggressively exploring how to extend our product portfolio to other categories of people with diabetes including those with Type 2\ndiabetes that are non-insulin using, people with pre-diabetes and people who are obese. Over the longer term, we plan to develop networked platforms with open\narchitecture, connectivity and transmitters capable of communicating with other devices and software systems. We also intend to expand our efforts to accumulate\nCGM patient data and metrics and apply predictive modeling and machine learning to generate interactive CGM insights that can inform patient behavior.\nOur product development timelines depend on our ability to achieve clinical endpoints, regulatory and legal requirements and to overcome technology\nchallenges. Product development timelines may be delayed due to extended regulatory approval timelines, scheduling issues with patients and investigators,\nrequests from institutional review boards, sensor performance and manufacturing supply constraints, among other factors. In addition, support of these clinical\ntrials requires significant resources from employees involved in the production of our products, including research and development, manufacturing, quality\nassurance, and clinical and regulatory personnel. Even if our development and clinical trial efforts are successful, the FDA may not approve our products, and even\nif approved, we may not achieve acceptance in the marketplace by physicians and people with diabetes.\nBackground\nDiabetes is a disease with significant adverse consequences for human health throughout the world. The International Diabetes Federation, or IDF , estimates\nthat in 2017, 425 million people around the world had diabetes, and the Centers for Disease Control, or CDC , estimates that in 2017, diabetes affected 30.3 million\npeople in the United States, of which 7.2 million were undiagnosed. IDF estimates that by 2045, the worldwide incidence of people suffering from diabetes will\nreach 629 million. According to the CDC 's National Vital Statistics Reports for 2015, diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death by disease in the United\nStates. According to the Congressional Diabetes Caucus website, diabetes is the leading cause of kidney failure, adult-onset blindness, lower-limb amputations,\nand significant cause of heart disease and stroke, high blood pressure and nerve damage. According to the IDF , there were an estimated 4 million deaths\nattributable to diabetes globally in 2017 between the ages of 20 and 79 years. The American Diabetes Association, or ADA , Fast Facts, revised in August 2017,\nstates that diabetes is the primary cause of death for more than 80,000 Americans each year, and contributes to the death of more than 250,000 Americans annually.\nAccording to an article published in The New England Journal of Medicine in November 2014, excess mortality for people with diabetes with ages of less than 30\nyears is largely explained by acute complications of diabetes.\n5",{"entities":[[1,13,"MEDICAL DEVICE TECHNOLOGY"],[154,161,"CHEMICALS"],[294,301,"CHEMICALS"],[408,415,"CHEMICALS"],[561,588,"MEDICAL DEVICE TECHNOLOGY"],[594,619,"MEDICAL DEVICE TECHNOLOGY"],[730,742,"MEDICAL DEVICE TECHNOLOGY"],[746,757,"MEDICAL DEVICE TECHNOLOGY"],[818,841,"MEDICAL DEVICE TECHNOLOGY"],[865,872,"DISEASE"],[931,938,"DISEASE"],[952,984,"MEDICAL DEVICE TECHNOLOGY"],[1014,1030,"MEDICAL DEVICE TECHNOLOGY"],[1250,1281,"MEDICAL DEVICE TECHNOLOGY"],[1340,1348,"DISEASE"],[1416,1451,"LAW"],[1453,1485,"LAW"],[1492,1516,"LAW"],[1528,1548,"LAW"],[1550,1558,"LAW"],[1577,1607,"LAW"],[1616,1622,"LAW"],[1666,1721,"MEDICAL DEVICE TECHNOLOGY"],[1722,1756,"LAW"],[1835,1841,"LAW"],[1943,1974,"LAW"],[1975,2009,"LAW"],[2220,2226,"LAW"],[2484,2519,"MEDICAL DEVICE TECHNOLOGY"],[2656,2671,"DISEASE"],[2712,2724,"DISEASE"],[2744,2750,"DISEASE"],[2983,2999,"MEDICAL DEVICE TECHNOLOGY"],[3087,3099,"MEDICAL DEVICE TECHNOLOGY"],[3221,3231,"LAW"],[3236,3241,"LAW"],[3355,3374,"LAW"],[3874,3877,"LAW"],[4019,4038,"DISEASE"],[4133,4166,"LAW"],[4171,4174,"LAW"],[4241,4249,"DISEASE"],[4259,4286,"LAW"],[4291,4294,"LAW"],[4321,4329,"DISEASE"],[4420,4423,"LAW"],[4497,4505,"DISEASE"],[4547,4550,"LAW"],[4598,4606,"DISEASE"],[4696,4725,"LAW"],[4735,4743,"DISEASE"],[4768,4782,"DISEASE"],[4784,4805,"DISEASE"],[4807,4829,"DISEASE"],[4856,4869,"DISEASE"],[4874,4880,"DISEASE"],[4882,4901,"DISEASE"],[4906,4919,"DISEASE"],[4937,4940,"LAW"],[5000,5008,"DISEASE"],[5067,5096,"LAW"],[5101,5104,"LAW"],[5155,5163,"DISEASE"],[5430,5438,"DISEASE"],[5518,5527,"DISEASE"]]}],["\fAmong people of all ages, 2015 data indicated the following: An estimated 23.1 million people or 7.2% of the U.S. population had been diagnosed with\ndiabetes. In addition to those newly diagnosed, the Congressional Diabetes Caucus website reports that every 24 hours there are: 238 amputations in people with\ndiabetes, 120 people who enter end-stage kidney disease programs, and 48 people who go blind.\nAccording to the ADA , one in every five healthcare dollars was spent on treating diabetes in 2012, and the direct medical costs and indirect expenditures\nattributable to diabetes in the United States were an estimated $245 billion, an increase of $71 billion, or approximately 41%, since 2007. Of the $245 billion in\noverall expenses, the ADA estimated that approximately $176 billion were direct costs associated with diabetes care, chronic complications and excess general\nmedical costs, and $69 billion were indirect costs. The ADA also found that average medical expenditures among people with diagnosed diabetes were 2.3 times\nhigher than for people without diabetes in 2012. According to the IDF , 2017 expenditures attributable to diabetes were estimated to be $727 billion globally. The\nIDF estimates that expenditures attributable to diabetes will grow to $776 billion globally by 2045.\nContinuous Glucose Monitoring\nWe believe continuous glucose monitoring has the potential to enable more people with diabetes to achieve and sustain tight glycemic control. The Diabetes\nControl and Complications Trial , or DCCT, demonstrated that improving blood glucose control lowers the risk of developing diabetes-related complications by up\nto 50%. The study also demonstrated that people with Type 1 diabetes achieved sustained benefits with intensive management. Yet, according to an article\npublished in the Journal of the American Medical Association in 2004, less than 50% of diabetes patients were meeting ADA standards for glucose control (A1c),\nand only 37% of people with diabetes were achieving their glycemic targets. According to an article published in The New England Journal of Medicine in\nNovember 2014, in two national registries, only 13% to 15% of people with diabetes met treatment guidelines for good glycemic control, and more than 20% had\nvery poor glycemic control. The CDC estimated that as of 2006, 63.4% of all adults with diabetes were monitoring their blood glucose levels on a daily basis, and\nthat 86.7% of insulin-requiring patients with diabetes monitored daily.\nVarious clinical studies also demonstrate the benefits of continuous glucose monitoring and that continuous glucose monitoring is equally effective in\npatients who administer insulin through multiple daily injections or through use of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion pumps. Results of a Juvenile Diabetes\nResearch Foundation, or JDRF , study published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2008, and the extension phase of the study, published in Diabetes\nCare in 2009, demonstrated that continuous glucose monitoring improved A1c levels and reduced incidence of hypoglycemia for patients over the age of 25 and\nfor all patients of all ages who utilized continuous glucose monitoring regularly. In 2016, the first and only randomized, controlled study focusing solely on the\nbenefit of continuous glucose monitoring for diabetes patients using multiple daily injections, or MDI, insulin therapy showed DexCom CGM System users on\nMDI achieved a one percent average A1c reduction after 24 weeks of regular use, compared to their baseline. Study participants also increased time spent in their\ntarget A1c range and spent less time in hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia when they used a DexCom CGM System compared to those who used only a standard\nblood glucose meter to monitor their glucose. This DIaMonD study (Multiple Daily Injections and Continuous Glucose Monitoring in Diabetes) is the first-of-itskind in demonstrating the impact of CGM only, without insulin pumps or other therapeutic interventions, on A1c and hypoglycemia in participants using a multiple\ndaily injection insulin regimen.\nOur current target market consists primarily of people with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes who utilize insulin pump therapy or who utilize multiple daily insulin\ninjections. We have recently begun to target people with Type 2 diabetes on multiple daily injection therapy and expect to expand our target market to include all\npeople with diabetes, people with pre-diabetes and people who are obese. Although the majority of our revenue has been generated in the United States, we have\nexpanded our operations to include Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and portions of Europe, Asia, the Middle East, Latin America and Africa.\nCommercial Operations\nWe have built a direct sales organization in the United States, Canada and certain countries in Europe to call on endocrinologists, physicians and diabetes\neducators who can educate and influence patient adoption of continuous glucose monitoring. We believe that focusing efforts on these participants is important\ngiven the instrumental role they each play in the decision-making process for diabetes therapy. To complement our direct sales efforts, we have entered into\ndistribution arrangements in the United States and internationally that allow distributors to sell our products. We believe our direct, highly specialized and focused\nsales organization and our domestic and international distribution agreements are sufficient for us to support our sales efforts for at least the next twelve months.\nProduct revenues are generated from the sale of durable continuous glucose monitoring systems (receivers and transmitters) and disposable sensors through a\ndirect sales force in the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany,\n6",{"entities":[[150,159,"DISEASE"],[202,231,"LAW"],[310,318,"DISEASE"],[351,365,"DISEASE"],[421,424,"LAW"],[486,494,"DISEASE"],[575,583,"DISEASE"],[744,747,"LAW"],[824,832,"DISEASE"],[839,860,"DISEASE"],[936,939,"LAW"],[1013,1021,"DISEASE"],[1068,1076,"DISEASE"],[1103,1106,"LAW"],[1143,1151,"DISEASE"],[1200,1203,"LAW"],[1248,1256,"DISEASE"],[1301,1330,"MEDICAL DEVICE TECHNOLOGY"],[1342,1371,"MEDICAL DEVICE TECHNOLOGY"],[1417,1425,"DISEASE"],[1455,1463,"CHEMICALS"],[1477,1517,"LAW"],[1523,1527,"LAW"],[1557,1570,"CHEMICALS"],[1699,1714,"DISEASE"],[1831,1859,"LAW"],[1886,1894,"DISEASE"],[1917,1920,"LAW"],[1952,1955,"DISEASE"],[1986,1994,"DISEASE"],[2016,2024,"CHEMICALS"],[2277,2285,"CHEMICALS"],[2299,2302,"LAW"],[2355,2363,"DISEASE"],[2386,2399,"CHEMICALS"],[2559,2588,"MEDICAL DEVICE TECHNOLOGY"],[2598,2627,"MEDICAL DEVICE TECHNOLOGY"],[2676,2683,"CHEMICALS"],[2760,2767,"CHEMICALS"],[3002,3031,"MEDICAL DEVICE TECHNOLOGY"],[3077,3089,"DISEASE"],[3168,3197,"MEDICAL DEVICE TECHNOLOGY"],[3300,3329,"MEDICAL DEVICE TECHNOLOGY"],[3334,3342,"DISEASE"],[3416,3433,"MEDICAL DEVICE TECHNOLOGY"],[3645,3657,"DISEASE"],[3662,3675,"DISEASE"],[3693,3710,"MEDICAL DEVICE TECHNOLOGY"],[4027,4039,"DISEASE"],[4184,4192,"DISEASE"],[4328,4336,"DISEASE"],[4964,4994,"MEDICAL DEVICE TECHNOLOGY"],[5620,5646,"MEDICAL DEVICE TECHNOLOGY"]]}],["\fSwitzerland, Austria and Canada as well as through distribution arrangements in the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and in portions of Europe,\nAsia, Latin America, the Middle East and Africa.\nMarket Opportunity\nDiabetes\nDiabetes is a chronic, life-threatening disease for which there is no known cure. The disease is caused by the body’s inability to produce or effectively utilize\nthe hormone insulin. This inability prevents the body from adequately regulating blood glucose levels. Glucose, the primary source of energy for cells, must be\nmaintained at certain concentrations in the blood in order to permit optimal cell function and health. Normally, the pancreas provides control of blood glucose\nlevels by secreting the hormone insulin to decrease blood glucose levels when concentrations are too high. In people with diabetes, the body does not produce\nsufficient levels of insulin, or fails to utilize insulin effectively, causing blood glucose levels to rise above normal. This condition is called hyperglycemia and often\nresults in chronic long-term complications such as heart disease, limb amputations, loss of kidney function and blindness. When blood glucose levels are high,\npeople with diabetes often administer insulin in an effort to decrease blood glucose levels. Unfortunately, insulin administration can drive blood glucose levels\nbelow the normal range, resulting in hypoglycemia. In cases of severe hypoglycemia, people with diabetes risk acute complications, such as loss of consciousness\nor death. Due to the drastic nature of acute complications associated with hypoglycemia, many people with diabetes are reluctant to reduce blood glucose levels.\nConsequently, these individuals often remain in a hyperglycemic state, increasing their odds of developing long-term chronic complications. Diabetes is typically\nclassified into two major groups: Type 1 and Type 2.\nType 1 Diabetes\nAccording to the ADA and JDRF, as of 2012 there were an estimated 1.3 million people with Type 1 diabetes in the United States. Type 1 diabetes is an\nautoimmune disorder that usually develops during childhood and is characterized by an absence of insulin, resulting from destruction of the insulin producing cells\nof the pancreas. Individuals with Type 1 diabetes must rely on frequent insulin injections in order to regulate and maintain blood glucose levels.\nAccording to JDRF, 40,000 people are diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes each year in the United States and between the years 2001-2009 there was a 21%\nincrease in the prevalence of Type 1 diabetes in people under the age of 20. In addition, according to the National Diabetes Statistics Report in 2009, there were an\nestimated 18,436 people younger than the age of 20 years old were diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes in the United States.\nType 2 Diabetes\nAccording to the ADA, in 2012 there were approximately 27.8 million people in the United States with Type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes is a metabolic\ndisorder which results when the body is unable to produce sufficient amounts of insulin or becomes insulin resistant. Depending on the severity of Type 2 diabetes,\nindividuals may require diet and nutrition management, exercise, oral medications or insulin injections to regulate blood glucose levels. We estimate that\napproximately 6.0 million Type 2 patients must use insulin to manage their diabetes.\nType 2 diabetes is occurring with increasing frequency in young people, with the increase in prevalence related to an increase in obesity amongst children.\nAccording to the CDC, as of 2012, approximately 17% of children and adolescents aged 2-19 years, or 12.7 million children, in the United States were obese.\nChildhood obesity has more than doubled in children and quadrupled in adolescents in the past 30 years.\n7",{"entities":[[52,77,"LAW"],[227,235,"DISEASE"],[236,244,"DISEASE"],[410,418,"CHEMICALS"],[479,492,"CHEMICALS"],[501,508,"CHEMICALS"],[704,717,"CHEMICALS"],[750,757,"CHEMICALS"],[770,783,"CHEMICALS"],[840,848,"DISEASE"],[897,904,"CHEMICALS"],[926,933,"CHEMICALS"],[955,968,"DISEASE"],[1023,1036,"DISEASE"],[1098,1111,"DISEASE"],[1113,1129,"DISEASE"],[1131,1154,"DISEASE"],[1159,1169,"DISEASE"],[1175,1188,"CHEMICALS"],[1218,1226,"DISEASE"],[1244,1251,"CHEMICALS"],[1277,1290,"CHEMICALS"],[1314,1321,"CHEMICALS"],[1347,1360,"CHEMICALS"],[1405,1418,"DISEASE"],[1438,1450,"DISEASE"],[1464,1472,"DISEASE"],[1604,1616,"DISEASE"],[1635,1643,"DISEASE"],[1668,1681,"CHEMICALS"],[1740,1753,"DISEASE"],[1830,1838,"DISEASE"],[1905,1920,"DISEASE"],[1938,1941,"LAW"],[1946,1950,"LAW"],[2011,2026,"DISEASE"],[2049,2064,"DISEASE"],[2168,2175,"CHEMICALS"],[2211,2218,"CHEMICALS"],[2269,2284,"DISEASE"],[2307,2314,"CHEMICALS"],[2360,2373,"CHEMICALS"],[2395,2399,"LAW"],[2434,2449,"DISEASE"],[2559,2574,"DISEASE"],[2776,2791,"DISEASE"],[2814,2829,"DISEASE"],[2847,2850,"LAW"],[2931,2947,"DISEASE"],[2948,2963,"DISEASE"],[3059,3066,"CHEMICALS"],[3078,3085,"CHEMICALS"],[3126,3141,"DISEASE"],[3228,3235,"CHEMICALS"],[3259,3272,"CHEMICALS"],[3324,3330,"DISEASE"],[3349,3356,"CHEMICALS"],[3373,3382,"DISEASE"],[3383,3398,"DISEASE"],[3556,3559,"LAW"],[3688,3694,"DISEASE"],[3705,3712,"DISEASE"]]}],["\fDiabetes & Glucose Management in the Hospital Setting\nThere are various subgroups of people with diabetes, including in-hospital patients, who present significant management challenges. According to the ADA,\ndiabetes related hospitalizations totaled 43.1 million days in 2012, an increase of 18.8 million days from 2007. Additionally, studies show that many hospital\npatients without diabetes suffer episodes of hyperglycemia. According to a Diabetes Care article, as of 1998, as many as 1.5 million hospitalized patients had\nsignificant hyperglycemia without a history of diabetes. A November 2001 article in the New England Journal of Medicine summarized a study of over 1,500\nhospitalized patients, of which only 13% had diabetes, which concluded that intensive insulin therapy to maintain blood glucose levels within a target range\nreduced mortality among critically ill patients in the surgical intensive care unit and improved patient outcomes. According to the CDC, as of 2009 there were 5.5\nmillion hospital discharges with diabetes as a listed diagnosis and 688,000 hospital discharges with diabetes listed as the primary diagnosis. More than 40% of all\nhealth care expenditures attributed to diabetes come from higher rates of hospital admission and longer average lengths of stay per admission, constituting the\nsingle largest contributor to the medical cost of diabetes. Of the projected $475 billion in national expenditures for hospital inpatient care, approximately $124\nbillion is incurred by people who have diabetes, of which $76 billion is directly attributed to their diabetes.\nImportance of Glucose Monitoring\nBlood glucose levels can be affected by many factors, including the carbohydrate and fat content of meals, exercise, stress, illness or impending illness,\nhormonal releases, variability in insulin absorption and changes in the effects of insulin in the body. Given the many factors that affect blood glucose levels,\nmaintaining glucose within a normal range is difficult, resulting in frequent and unpredictable excursions above or below normal blood glucose levels. People with\ndiabetes administer insulin or ingest carbohydrates throughout the day in order to maintain blood glucose levels within normal ranges. People with diabetes\nfrequently overcorrect and fluctuate between hyperglycemic and hypoglycemic states, often multiple times during the same day. As a result, many people with\ndiabetes are routinely outside the normal blood glucose range. People with diabetes are often unaware that their glucose levels are either too high or too low, and\ntheir inability to completely control blood glucose levels and the associated serious complications can be frustrating and, at times, overwhelming.\nIn an attempt to maintain blood glucose levels within the normal range, people with diabetes must first measure their blood glucose levels. Often after\nmeasuring their blood glucose levels, people with diabetes make therapeutic adjustments. As adjustments are made, additional blood glucose measurements may be\nnecessary to gauge the individual’s response to the adjustments. More frequent testing of blood glucose levels provides people with diabetes with information that\ncan be used to better understand and manage their diabetes. The ADA recommends that most people with Type 1 diabetes test their blood glucose levels at least\nthree or more times per day, and that significantly more frequent testing may be required to reach A1c targets safely without hypoglycemia.\nClinical outcomes data support the notion that an important component of effective diabetes management is frequent monitoring of blood glucose levels. The\nlandmark 1993 DCCT consisting of patients with Type 1 diabetes, and the 1998 UK Prospective Diabetes Study, consisting of patients with Type 2 diabetes,\ndemonstrated that people with diabetes who intensely managed blood glucose levels delayed the onset and slowed the progression of diabetes-related\ncomplications. The DCCT demonstrated that intensive management reduced the risk of complications by 76% for eye disease, 60% for nerve disease and 50% for\nkidney disease, but also found that it led to a three-fold increase in the frequency of hypoglycemic events. In the December 2005 edition of the New England\nJournal of Medicine , the authors of a peer-reviewed study concluded that intensive diabetes therapy has long-term beneficial effects on the risk of cardiovascular\ndisease in patients with Type 1 diabetes. The study showed that intensive diabetes therapy reduced the risk of cardiovascular disease by 42% and the risk of nonfatal heart attack, stroke or death from cardiovascular disease by 57%.",{"entities":[[1,9,"DISEASE"],[12,19,"CHEMICALS"],[98,106,"DISEASE"],[204,207,"LAW"],[209,217,"DISEASE"],[385,393,"DISEASE"],[413,427,"DISEASE"],[443,451,"DISEASE"],[539,552,"DISEASE"],[574,583,"DISEASE"],[725,733,"DISEASE"],[766,773,"CHEMICALS"],[794,807,"CHEMICALS"],[969,972,"LAW"],[1033,1041,"DISEASE"],[1101,1109,"DISEASE"],[1203,1211,"DISEASE"],[1374,1383,"DISEASE"],[1526,1534,"DISEASE"],[1589,1598,"DISEASE"],[1613,1631,"MEDICAL DEVICE TECHNOLOGY"],[1632,1645,"CHEMICALS"],[1700,1712,"CHEMICALS"],[1821,1828,"CHEMICALS"],[1870,1877,"CHEMICALS"],[1926,1939,"CHEMICALS"],[1960,1967,"CHEMICALS"],[2077,2090,"CHEMICALS"],[2111,2119,"DISEASE"],[2131,2138,"CHEMICALS"],[2149,2162,"CHEMICALS"],[2203,2216,"CHEMICALS"],[2258,2266,"DISEASE"],[2312,2325,"CHEMICALS"],[2330,2342,"CHEMICALS"],[2423,2431,"DISEASE"],[2465,2478,"CHEMICALS"],[2498,2506,"DISEASE"],[2536,2543,"CHEMICALS"],[2625,2638,"CHEMICALS"],[2761,2774,"CHEMICALS"],[2819,2827,"DISEASE"],[2853,2866,"CHEMICALS"],[2903,2916,"CHEMICALS"],[2937,2945,"DISEASE"],[3012,3025,"CHEMICALS"],[3136,3149,"CHEMICALS"],[3178,3186,"DISEASE"],[3259,3268,"DISEASE"],[3273,3276,"LAW"],[3310,3325,"DISEASE"],[3337,3350,"CHEMICALS"],[3493,3506,"DISEASE"],[3590,3598,"DISEASE"],[3636,3649,"CHEMICALS"],[3798,3813,"DISEASE"],[3845,3853,"DISEASE"],[3876,3889,"CHEMICALS"],[4070,4081,"DISEASE"],[4091,4104,"DISEASE"],[4117,4131,"DISEASE"],[4205,4225,"DISEASE"],[4358,4366,"DISEASE"],[4423,4445,"DISEASE"],[4463,4479,"DISEASE"],[4512,4520,"DISEASE"],[4549,4571,"DISEASE"],[4595,4616,"DISEASE"],[4618,4624,"DISEASE"],[4639,4661,"DISEASE"]]}],null,["\fLimitations of Existing Glucose Monitoring Products\nSingle-point finger stick devices are the most prevalent devices for glucose monitoring.
